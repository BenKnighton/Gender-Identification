# Gender-Identification

Gender recognition was a facet of my A.I assistantsâ€™ abilities. This code uses a neural network, made using the libraries: Librosa, NumPy and Keras. The model was trained on a large number of labelled data, and the model was saved as a h5 file. This is the same code I use in my A.I Assistant, and is therefore designed for speed as well as being incredibly accurate.

### Run Gender.py to start the code. The neural net model is called: gender_model.h5
